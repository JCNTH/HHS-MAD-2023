## Requirements

To use the HHS-MAD 2023 mobile app, ensure that your device meets the following requirements:

1. iOS: iOS 12.0 or higher

## Installation

### iOS

To install the HHS-MAD 2023 app on an iOS device, follow these steps:

1. Download the project source code from GitHub.
2. Open the Terminal app on your Mac.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
4. Run the command `pod install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Open the `HHS-MAD.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
6. Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable.
7. Select your device as the build target.
8. Click the "Build and run" button to build and install the app on your device.

## Usage/Instructions

Upon opening the app for the first time, follow these steps to maximize your experience:

1. Sign in using your school credentials (email and password).
2. Complete your profile by adding a profile picture and personal information.
3. Navigate the app using the bottom menu bar to access the Social Feed, Calendar, Messaging System, and Academics.
4. You can post academic questions, as well as photos to share with peers, and approved accounts (such as teachers or club officers) are able to post events that can be seen and accessed by students. 

## Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets from the project and their explanations:

### Events Page

The Events Page feature of the HHS-MAD 2023 app is implemented using a table view to display posts, with direct linking to wepages. The data is stored and retrieved using Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL document-based database provided by Firebase.

```swift
// Retrieve events page posts from Firestore
db.collection("event_page").order(by: "timestamp", descending: true).getDocuments { (snapshot, error) in
   if error == nil && snapshot != nil {
      var posts = [Post]()
      for doc in snapshot!.documents {
         let post = Post(data: doc.data())
         posts.append(post)
      }
      completion(.success(posts))
   } else {
      completion(.failure(error!))
   }
}
```

The above code snippet shows the implementation of the retrieval of event feed posts from Firestore in the `getPosts` function. The function queries the `event_page` collection in Firestore and orders the results by timestamp in descending order. The data is then converted into `Event` objects and returned in a `success` result, otherwise an `error` is returned in a `failure` result.

### Messaging System

The Messaging System feature of the HHS-MAD 2023 app is implemented using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), a messaging service provided by Google that allows the app to receive and send messages.

```swift
// Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging
Messaging.messaging().delegate = self
Messaging.messaging().isAutoInitEnabled = true
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
   UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
   let authOptions: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .badge, .sound]
   UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: authOptions) { (granted, error) in
      if granted {
         DispatchQueue.main.async {
            UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
         }
      } else {
         print(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
      }
   }
} else {
   let settings: UIUserNotificationSettings = UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.alert, .badge, .sound], categories: nil)
   UIApplication.shared.registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
   UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
}
```

The above code snippet shows the configuration of Firebase Cloud Messaging in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` function in the `AppDelegate.swift` file. The code sets the app's messaging delegate, enables automatic initialization of FCM, and requests authorization to display notifications from the user. If the authorization is granted, the app registers for remote notifications.
